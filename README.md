This project showcases my three favorite pie recipies!
The skills that are being used and reinforced are:
<ul>
    <li>creation of a repo and git usage in terminal</li>
    <li>html boilerplate creation: as the basis for all html files</li>
    <li>html text "h1...h7,strong,em,p": in the description of recipes</li>
    <li>html "ol" ordered and "ul" unordered lists: in ingredients and recipes sections</li>
    <li>html "a" links: to access other recipes and home</li>
    <li>html "img" images: for images of pie</li>
    <li>basic css styling </li>
</ul>
