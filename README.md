# teo-recipes
This project showcases my three favorite pie recipies!
The skills that are being used and reinforced are 
    creation of a repo and git usage in terminal
    html boilerplate creation: as the basis for all html files
    html text <h1>...<h7>,<strong>,<em>,<p>: in the description of recipes
    html <ol> ordered and <ul> unordered lists: in ingredients and recipes sections
    html <a> links: to access other recipes and home
    html <img> images: for images of pie
