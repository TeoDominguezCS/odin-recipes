        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This delicious pie was created for a very special new years party! It was originally going to be a guava pie since my neighbor gifted me an entire bag of guavas on a whim but they didn't ripen in time and were rather crunchy and bitter when sliced. Last second I bought a bag of mixed berries and substituted them into my first blueberry pie recipie! The raspberries and blackberries add a depth and sweetness that cannot be achieved just with blueberries alone!</p>

            <li>Use extra dough to create more designs (I had enough to make a 2024 and two hearts!)</li>
            <li>Assemble designs and coat entire top with a layer of eggwash</li>
            <li>Sprinkle top with course sugar as desired, go crazy here to make the crust extra tasty</li>
            <li>Bake at 425F for 25 minutes</li>
